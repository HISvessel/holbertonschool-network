Introductory projects for network basics.

Topics to discuss:
OSI Model
Types of network
MAC and IP address
UDP and TCP
Ports

1) OSI models:
-> open system interconnection; a reference model that provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for systme interconnections.
-> it was developed by the International Organization of Standardization.
-> The system connection protocol contains 7 layers of abstractions:
    1) Physical
    2) Data Link
    3) Network
    4) Transport
    5) Session
    6) Presentation
    7) Application

2) Types of network:
-> LAN: local area network, one of the two primary and best known categories of area networks. These connect network devices over a short distance. Single LANs are contained in offices, schools and homes, sometimes even multiple LANs. In tcp/ip networking, LANs are often implemented as a single IP subnet. And finally, LANs are typically operated and managed by a single person.

->

-> WAN: wide area network, one of the two primary and best known categories of area networks. This network spreads a large physical area, with the internet being the largest WAN, spanning the Earth. WANs are a geographically dispersed collection of LANs, which connect between each other by use of a router. in IP networking, the router maintains both a LAN address and a WAN address. 

Differences between a LAN and a WAN:
->most WANs are not owned by a single organization, instead existing under collective ownership and management, unlike LANs, which are typically affiliated to a single user's ownership and management. 

-> WLAN: wireless local area network, a LAN based on WiFI wireless nwtwork technology.
-> SAN: Storage Area Network, which connects to data storage devices through technology like Fibre Channel. 
-> MAN: metropolitan area network, wihich are network spanning an area physically larger than a LAN but not quite up to the size of a WAN, like a city. Operated by a single entity. 
-> CAN: campus area network, a network spanning multiple LANs but are smaller than a MAN, such as academic institutions or local business campus. 
-> PAN: personal area network, or a network that surrounds a single individual. WPAN(wireless PAN) can be made through such an instance as a Bluetooth connection between devices. 
-> POLAN: passive optical LAN, serves fiber by using fiber optic splitters to allow a single optical fiber to serve multiple devices. 

There are also other types of private networks engineered with layers of security, such as a VPN(virtual private network) or a EPN(enterprise private network)
