A followup to the basics of networking, where we discuss the following topics:

1) localhosts
2) hostfiles
3) netcasts with examples

Localhosts:
-> it is a hostname that refers to the current computer to access it. It is ussed to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. 

The name localhpst is reserved for the loopback purpose, which is the routing of electronic signals back to their source without intentional processing or modification(return to sender/ git it bacl to the localhost). The loopback serves as a mean of testing the communication infrastructure. 



IPv4 is the normally known address 127.0.0.1
